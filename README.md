## Frontend Workshop

This is where I work with the latest frontend technologies. The internet should be fun, so this is where I break things, learn why they broke, and fix them. My focus here is to understand how and why something works.

#### Check out some of the things in [lib](https://github.com/sprintup/frontend-workshop/tree/master/lib) or the mindless challenge of getting everyone to work together at [http://sprintup.github.io/frontend-workshop/](http://sprintup.github.io/frontend-workshop/)

## Frontend Workshop

This is where I work with the latest frontend technologies. The internet should be fun, so this is where I break things, learn why they broke, and fix them. My focus here is to understand how and why something works.

#### Check out some of the things in [lib](https://github.com/sprintup/frontend-workshop/tree/master/lib) or the mindless challenge of getting everyone to work together at [http://sprintup.github.io/frontend-workshop/](http://sprintup.github.io/frontend-workshop/)

Things that I learned are included in the related README files in their respective [lib/*](https://github.com/sprintup/frontend-workshop/tree/master/lib) directory. In a more general sense I also learned about 
* [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)
* [code folding](http://wesbos.com/sublime-text-code-folding/) with Sublime Text
* Preventing CSS Attribute collisions and modularizing CSS code
* Working with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* [CSS Specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/)
* Practice with the box model
* The difference between a [section and a div](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6939864/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div)
* Live CSS editing using chrome dev tools
* Using CDNs 
* Bootstrap
